      </div><!-- bio1 -->


      <div id="bio2">
        <h4>2001 (25 years old)</h4>
        
        <p>He starts a programmers band call it "JavaMola!" (JavaRules!), a group of technology enthusiasts 
          who get together to offer talks to each other, share knowledge, discuss view points 
          and do freak stuff in long sessions of
          <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html"
          name="Pair Programming Definición">pair-programming</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Is named as operator of the channel #java on the IRC.Hispano.</p>

        <h4>2002 (26 years old)</h4>

        <p>Someone from the JavaMola! community bites him with something calls Linux, 
          which apparently is a whirlwind of fun. 
          He manages to install a RedHat and configure a perfect development environment. 
          Learning from the difficulty, he pass the test and falls in love.</p>
        
        <p>The next evolutionary step was to Gentoo, and its packages system and dependencies management, 
          and, above all, its documentation and community, makes him even happier. 
          On 2008 he will catch the ecstasy enjoying the stability and ease of use of Ubuntu.
          On 2009 he will become into a Mac OSX user.</p>
          
        <h4>2003 (27 years old)</h4>

          an implementation of MVC pattern and a content manager system of his own harvest.</p>

        <p>He fells time at time increasingly his passion, 
          he participates for the first time in a Demoscene conquest 
          on the EuskalParty 2002 Lan Party along with his partner Yuyah,

          Criatures</a>
          Let us be clear: not too much professional. 
          JavaCriatures ends on the 13th position of the classification, 
          which is the same thing to say: the last. 
          But that is not the important thing, the important point is that 
          a 3D engine was implemented on a week and rewritten from scratch within 3 days,
          without any knowledge of how to perform this type of work, 
          with a geometry knowledge rather basic and without sleep for several days.</p>
        
        <p>Also develops a prototype of 2D platforms video game "Resident Pevil" 
          with intelligent behavior of the enemies.

          a group for compulsive and enthusiastic not only Java but computing in general, 
          including Linux, of course. People willing to share knowledge.</p>
        
        <p>The attempt was thwarted by legal issues but on the way he meet with groups of people 
          already doing such activities and interests similar to him:
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacklab" title="Hacklabs">the hacklabs</a>.</p>
