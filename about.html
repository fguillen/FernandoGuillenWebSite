        <h1>Who I am</h1>
        <p>I'm <strong>Fernando Guillen</strong>, born in an small city of the north of 
          Spain on 1976. I have been
          living on a bunch of capitals around three continents.</p>
        <p>My academic history is half part technical and half part artistic. But the most
          of my skills have built in the <strong>experience</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm a <strong>cabinetmaker of the web development</strong> and I have a 
          <strong>long history</strong> on this profession.. still loving it.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <p>I do <strong>high quality ad-hoc web applications development</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>What I don't do</h1>
        <p>Although I love beautiful things, I am used to design my own pet-projects
          and I consider my self like a creative person I am not a graphic professional 
          designer. <strong>I don't do professional web design</strong>. Amongst other things
          because I'm not good on it. I you don't know who ask for the graphic
          side of your project I can offer you a few very confident contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>I don't do multi-purpose CMS integration</strong>, if your needs could be implemented
          using one of the thousand generic software solutions there are on the Internet,
          a lot of them for free, I'm not the best guy for help you. I am where something 
          exclusive is need.</p>
        <p>What I offer is <strong>not a commodity</strong>, I can offer nothing to you
          if what you want is something that any programmer can do.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Why hiring me</h1>
        <p>I'm <strong>not competitive</strong>, I always will say honestly if 
          I'm the appropriate person to
          face up your project, or if not, I'll try to offer you possible colleagues that
          can solve it better than me.</p>
        <p>As I don't offer fixed estimations I <strong>can afford client decisions changes</strong>, 
          and as I am an agile development fan I can face up them as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>I use <strong>the most productive web development tools</strong> so I can offer 
          same, sometimes more,
          quality on less time.</p>
        <p>Although my speciality is the backside development, I have knowledge, 
          some parts more other less, of <strong>every phase and layer
          of the web development</strong>. Functionality analysis, team management,
          usability decisions, XHTML/CSS, 
          front script technics, servers configuration and maintenance, databases, etc.</p>
        <p>I'm on <strong>continuos and friendly contact with very high-tech professionals</strong> and
          we like to help one to each other in case of doubt or support needs.</p>
        <p>I really concern on the <strong>client satisfaction</strong>, I never have left a client
          in the lurch, and, if my memory serves me correctly, I have always carried 
          out the expectations. If someone thinks different but he hasn't told to me, 
          please, do it.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>How hiring me</h1>
        <p>There are a few things I need before I can say if I'm the appropriate person to solve
          your development needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PSD or XHTML mock-ups of your web service</li>
          <li>Desired timing for the first public production version.</li>
          <li>Budget range available for the development phase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also would like <strong>to know something from you</strong> and the team you are representing,
          to get to know the people I am going to work with is very important to me.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>How I work</h1>
        <p>I work on <strong>weekly milestones</strong>, 
          <strong>daily activity reports</strong>, <strong>full and continuos contact
          with the client</strong>.</p>
        <p>I work <strong>remotely</strong>, personal meetings are possible if we decided they will
          offer something valuable and productive for the project.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Which is my budget</h1>
        <p>I <strong>don't offer fixed budget or fixed timing</strong> for the development of a whole project, 
          but on depending the offered mock-ups, the desired timing and the available budget I can
          offer a approximation.</p>
        <p>On depending the dedication the project requires and the timings available my 
          weekly budget is around <strong>750€</strong>, plus taxes. If the project requires exclusive 
          dedication or needs something from my leisure and free time the budget will be
          increased.</p>
        <p>Even the simplest web service needs at less 4 or 6 weeks development, without taking 
          into account the possible delay until I finish what I'm doing and I can face up a new project.
          The great majority takes about <strong>8 weeks</strong> until a public beta version, and 4 weeks more
          fixing and stabilizing the whole functionality.</p>
        <p>If personal meetings are necessary travel and accommodation costs will be added
          to the next invoice.</p>
        <p>Payments will be made weekly.</p>
