        <h1>Who I am</h1>

        <p>My name is <strong>Fernando Guillen</strong>. I was born 
          in a small city in the North of Spain on 1976. 
          In recent years, I have lived in several capitals around three continents.
          I am currently living in Majorca, an small island in the Mediterranean.</p>
          
        <p>My academic background is half technical and half artistic, 
          but most of my skills have been built from experience. 
          I have worked in web development for a long time, 
          and continue to learn and develop my skills in the craft...
          I am still loving it.</p>
          
        <p>I'm a <strong>cabinetmaker of the web development</strong>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <p>I do <strong>high quality ad-hoc web applications back-side development</strong>.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>What I don't do</h1>
        <p>Although I love beautiful things, I used to design my own pet-projects
          and consider myself a creative person, 
          I am not a professional graphic designer.
          <strong>I don't do professional web design</strong>.
          Amongst other things because I'm not good on it.
          If you don't know who ask to for the graphic
          side of your project 
          I can recommend some excellent designers from my contacts.</p>
          
        <p><strong>I don't do multi-purpose CMS integration</strong>.
          For many clients, a generic software solution is the best 
          answer. These are readily available, often free, from the 
          Internet, and I don't do this kind of work.
          I am where an unique solution is needed.</p>
          
        <p>What I offer is <strong>not a commodity</strong>, 
          I can offer nothing to you
          if what you want is something that any programmer can do.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>Why hire me</h1>
        <p>I'm <strong>not a competitive professional</strong>,         
         I will honestly say whether or not if I would be 
         the best person for your project. If I am not I can 
         refer you to some more suitable colleagues.</p>
         
        <p>As I don't offer fixed estimates, I <strong>can accommodate 
          client decision changes</strong>. I can make changes quickly 
          and easily.</p>
          
        <p>I use <strong>the most productive web development tools</strong> 
          so I can produce better results faster.</p>
          
        <p>Although my speciality is the back-end development, 
          I have a good knowledge, in some fields more than others, 
          of <strong>every phase and layer of web development</strong>. 
          Functionality analysis, team management, usability decisions, 
          XHTML/CSS, front script technics, servers configuration and maintenance, 
          databases, etc...</p>
          

        <p>I am in <strong>regular contact with high level professionals</strong>
          in the same field of work, and we offer each other mutual 
          support, so there is always a solution to be found.</p>
          
        <p>My main concern is <strong>client satisfaction</strong>. 
          I have never 
          left a client in the lurch, and so far as I am aware, 
          have never had a dissatisfied client.</p>

      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>How to hire me</h1>
        <p>There are a few things I need before I can say if I'm the appropriate person to solve
          your development needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PSD or XHTML mock-ups of your web service</li>
          <li>Desired timing for the first public production version.</li>
          <li>Budget range available for the development phase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also would like <strong>to know something about you</strong> and the team you are representing,
          to get to know the people I'll be working with is very important to me.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="section">
        <h1>How I work</h1>
        <p>I work on <strong>weekly milestone</strong>, 
          <strong>daily activity reports</strong>, 
          <strong>full and continuos contact
          with the client</strong>.</p>
        <p>I usually work <strong>remotely</strong>, 
          but personal meetings are possible if we decide they will 
          offer something valuable and productive for the project.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="section">
        <h1>What is my budget</h1>
        <p>I <strong>don't offer fixed price or a fixed time</strong> 
          for the 
          development of the whole project, but depending on the 
          provided mock-ups, the desired timing and the available 
          budget I can offer you an estimation.</p>
          
        <p>Depending on the intensity and time-scale of the project, 
          my weekly rate would be around <strong>750€</strong> plus tax. 
          If the project requires exclusive dedication or working 
          outside normal hours, the fee would be 
          increased accordingly.</p>
          
        <p>Even the simplest web service needs at least 4 to 6 
          weeks development, and cannot be started until I have 
          finished any work in hand. 
          The great majority of projects take about <strong>8 weeks</strong> 
          until a public beta version is released, and 4 weeks more of 
          fixing and stabilizing the whole functionality 
          of the project.</p>
          
        <p>If personal meetings are necessary, travel and accommodation 
          costs will be added to the next invoice.</p>
          
        <p>Payments to be made weekly.</p>
