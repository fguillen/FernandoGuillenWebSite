Easy couple looking for a comfortable double room or flat on Berlin since October

Hi,

We're a couple looking to get away to Barlin, since October.

We're looking to rent a comfortable double room or flat for both of us, on some nice neighborhood like Kreutzberg.

As we are used to work with the computer it is very important Internet access on our room/flat.

We are a 33 years old couple, normal worker people, easy, noiseless, clean and respectful. We don't have money problems, but we are not rich people either, I (Fernando) am a professional freelance web developer with a lot of experience and not problems to find projects, one of my Berlin adventures will be try to find contacts between the local web developer comunity. Cecilia works as a Theater teacher here on the University of Palma of Mallorca, and she loves video-art and art in general, she will love to assist to any art event on the city.

We live in a very wonderful house on Mallorca (Spain): http://www.flickr.com/photos/d2clon/sets/72157616586695511/

And now we are traveling to New York because a personal and professional concern.

Cecilia is a Theater Teacher and she use to devour culture and art, and I, Fernando, am a Freelance Web Developer. This is because Berlin is a very good place for both of us to meet people and passionate meetings.
