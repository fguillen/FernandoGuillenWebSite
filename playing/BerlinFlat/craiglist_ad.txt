Easy couple looking for a comfortable double room or flat on Berlin since October.

Hi,

We're a couple looking to get away to Berlin, since October.

We're looking to rent a comfortable double room or flat for both of us, on some nice neighborhood.

As we used to work with the computer it is very important Internet access on our room/flat.

We need a fully-furnished room/apartment.

We are a 34 years old couple, normal worker people, easy, noiseless, clean and respectful.

Cecilia is a theater teacher and she use to devour culture and art, and I, Fernando, am a freelance web developer.

You can know us a little bit maybe looking on our websites:

    * Cecilia's personal site: http://ceciliamolano.com/

Or our flickrs:

Please contact with us, note on your mail the address of the flat and also send us pictures of the flat or the room so we could make us an idea of it.

Also don't hesitate to ask us whatever you need to know. Tell us also the price for the flat or the room or flat and every conditions you think are important.

Regards

fernando and cecilia
