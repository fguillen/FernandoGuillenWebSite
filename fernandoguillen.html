      <h3>Skills</h3>

      <h4>Self-Taught</h4>
      
      <p>I learned everything I know and I continue learning in a non-academic way. 
        Although I love to attend classrooms with a teacher teaching me,
        I have had to take almost every thing from Internet, books and community members talks.</p>

      <p><strong>Work</strong>, <strong>independence</strong> and <strong>self-management</strong>.</p>


      <h4>Professional Experience</h4>

      <p>I started as an independent developer in 2002 and in 2005 I founded a lovely 
        web development company (Constellation Networks) with my two partners 
        (Jesus Hurtado and Miguel Delgado), and in 2007 we were 8 persons on the team and several people outside.</p>

      <p>Playing the role of Director of Technology and Project Manager for 3 fantastic years 
        where they gave me freedom to demand the quality and taste for work well done.</p>

      <p><strong>Organization</strong>, <strong>teamwork</strong> and <strong>customer skills</strong>.</p>
      

      <h4>Passionate Programmer</h4>

      <p>I love biting code lines, doing things that work, the logic exercises. 
        Reference books or essays on the art of web development are often my bedside books.</p>
        
      <h4>Vocational</h4>

      <p>I have not landed on the world of web development just because years ago I didn't choose well 
        a career, I have come here for a natural choice because of the need to satisfy a concern.</p>
        
      <p><strong>I haven't a job but a profession</strong>, a profession that encourages me, a profession I enjoy.</p>
      

      <h4>Creative</h4>

      <p>I come from the world of the visual arts 
        and although there isn't much I can say about that 
        I have sensitivity to what is beautiful and original. 
        I focus the software development as an art that requires 
        <strong>ingenuity</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>passion</strong>.</p>

      <p>Looking for the most <strong>elegant design</strong>, and for the <strong>humanity of the code</strong>
        always thinking that the code will be used, and read by people.</p>

      <h4>Intuition</h4>

      <p>I am good at it, beyond the knowledge or experience, I have intuition. 
        Intuition to recognize <strong>the cause of a problem</strong>, propose <strong>solutions</strong>, 
        to <strong>anticipate</strong> what might be the best strategy, 
        the best design and, of course, to discover <strong>where I was wrong</strong> and need reconstruction.</p>

      <h4>Multidisciplinary</h4>
      
      <p>Although I only stand out in the design and development of software 
        I use to manage with facility <strong>system administration</strong>, graphic <strong>design</strong>, 
        <strong>front development</strong> and
        I have a lot of interest in web <strong>usability</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>standards</strong>.</p>

    <div id="deshabilidades">
      <h3>Un-Skills</h3>

      <h4>Self-Taught</h4>
      
      <p>I have no formal education studies, I have been very selective in the studies, 
        each time I have learnt what I thought more convenient to learn 
        and I've never had interest in matters that don't inspire me, I haven't been always right.</p>

      <p>My methodology is not academic. I only learn things if I find them interesting for 
        me on a possible scenario.</p>

      <h4>Not too much Orthodox</h4>
      
      <p>Could be some time I can not weak up early on the morning 
        and not be able to wear this tie for the meeting.</p>

      <p>I wary of confidential documents and long contract.

      <p>I can sometimes sin of pride and rock-cod.</p>


      <h4>Ignorant</h4>
      
      <p>Ignorant on advanced enterprise development concepts such: Web Services, SOAP, SAP, EJB, 
        Websphere, Oracle, ... And no interest in learning today.</p>
        

      <h4>Security Un-Carefully</h4>

      <p>If your project focuses on data security I am not the best.</p>

      <h4>Clumsy Polyglot</h4>

      <p>Clumsy and lazy with the English. Yes I read documentation in English 
      if needed, but I will look for it in Spanish before.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="gustos">
      <h3>Tastes and Preferences</h3>

      <h4>Ad-hoc Developments</h4>

      <p>Projects that because their very personal characteristics required of an
         ad-hoc development and not any generic application or tool can be used.</p>

      <h4>Web Development</h4>

      <p>It is where I have more experience, applications that run on the Internet, 
        which is an human the end user.</p>

      <h4>Small Projects</h4>

      <p>That may be developed between 1 and 3 (good :D) programmers, 
        whose budget is around 5.000-20.000 euros and 
        whose first beta version can be launched within 2 or 3 months.</p>
        
      <h4>Fun and Challenging Projects</h4>

      <p>Intended to be used en masse, can be showed, 
        have repercussions on the web scene and add something 
        interesting to the Internet.</p>
        
      <h4>Less is More</h4>

      <p>Adoration for simplicity.</p>

      <h4>Teleworking</h4>

      <p>My office is the most productive place, 
        I have no problems with travel to meetings even whole days, 
        but most of my work will be developed close to my resources: books, machines, notes.</p>

      <h4>Open Knowledge</h4>

      <p>I would like to return to the community at least part of what I got, 
        if the project provides, for active or passive, something to the Global Knowledge
        I will be more interesting on it.</p>

      <h4>Interest in the Design</h4>
      
      <p>In an application that had to interact with people is very important 
        the <strong>graphics</strong> and <strong>organization of information</strong>, a good web project 
        should have a reserved budget exclusively to provide a professional web design that meets 
        the tasks: usability, graphics and XHTM/CSS web coding.</p>
      

      <h4>Linux/Mac</h4>

      <p>I work much better and I find it funnier to work in a Linux or Mac OSX environments.</p>

      <h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>

      <p>On this moment I am only interested on work on <strong>Ruby on Rails Web Projects</strong>.</p>
